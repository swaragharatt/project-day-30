Swara Gharat's Portfolio & Dynamic Blog
A concise, single-page professional portfolio supplemented by a dynamic, multi-section blog. This repository documents technical projects, academic skills, and professional certifications relevant to Data Science and Web Development.

# Project Summary
This project comprises two interconnected front-end files:

Portfolio (index.html): A responsive, single-page entry point summarizing professional data across designated sections (Home, Career, Skills, Projects, Certifications, Contact).

Blog (blog.html): A detailed document containing articles, an extensive list of the "30 Days – 30 Projects Challenge," and all certifications. This file uses JavaScript for internal content management and filtering.

# Key Features
Portfolio (index.html)
Design & Aesthetics: Dark theme utilizing the Ametrine color palette (#8e44ad) for accents, ensuring high contrast and readability.

Projects Index: Card-based showcase of major projects, with a direct hyperlink to the comprehensive project log (#projectsChallenge) located within the blog.

Certifications Display: A dedicated gallery presenting professional credentials in a standardized card format, including relevant images.

Dynamic Blog (blog.html)
Modular Content Display: Utilizes client-side JavaScript to manage the visibility of three primary sections: Articles, 30 Days Projects, and Certifications.

Anchor Link Navigation: Configured to interpret URL anchor links (#projectsChallenge, #certificationsSection) on page load, ensuring seamless redirection from external sources to the intended content module.

Filtering Capability: Includes functional search and tag-based filtering for efficient navigation of content entries.

# Technology Specification
This is a front-end presentation built exclusively with foundational web standards:
